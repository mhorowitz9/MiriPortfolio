                <p>Hi! My name is Miri Horowitz, and I am a dedicated UX/UI designer with a passion for crafting user-centric digital experiences that seamlessly blend aesthetics with functionality, such as coding and designing this website. I have a double major in New Media Digital Design, with a concentration in Art, Text, Design, and Communications Media from Fordham University. 
                    With a background in both graphic design and front-end development, I bring a holistic approach to every project, ensuring each design not only looks visually appealing but also enhances user satisfaction and usability. My journey in design began with a fascination for the intersection of art and technology, and I continually strive to innovate and push boundaries in creating intuitive and engaging designs. Outside of work, I enjoy exploring new design trends, learning programming languages, and contributing to open-source projects that inspire creativity and growth.</p>
